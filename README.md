1) CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE (LINUX)
#
** Amazon EC2 - Virtual Server Hosting 
#

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
It has a Virtual computing environments, known as instances also it contains preconfigured templates for those instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), that package the bits which need for  server (including the operating system and additional software)

This lab session was about launching and configuring first Amazon Ec2 instance using AWS Management Console.

3) MANAGING INSTANCE VOLUMES USING EBS

** Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
#
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.
EBS supports a number of advanced storage features, including snapshotting and cloning.EBS volumes are built on replicated back end storage, so that the failure of a single component will not cause data loss.

During this laboratory, I was able to learn to create an EC2 instance with an additional EBS volume.Also learnt to attach and detach an EBS to/from a specific EC2 instance, take a snapshot, and master how to delete a volume.

4) CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON S3 BUCKET
#
Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3)
#
** Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that  can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.
This Lab session guides through the bucket creation process and its first usage. The Cloud Academy Labs Engine constantly checks the Lab environment, giving  instant feedback on  work.

5) CREATE AN EBS-BACKED LINUX AMI
#
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an EC2 instance. It customize an EC2 instance and then save the configuration as a custom AMI for  private or public use. Every EC2 instance launched selecting the customized AMI will contain any software or file that previously added.
#
During this lab session I was able to setup a webserver EC2 instance starting from a Linux AMI, and then generate a new AMI.

6) CREATE YOUR FIRST AMAZON RDS DATABASE
#
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks.Amazon RDS provides six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.
#
This lab session is focused on Amazon RDS. Follow along and learn to create and use first RDS database with Amazon AWS.
